    "answer": "Regulation (EU) 2016/679, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. Its primary objectives include protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly their right to the protection of personal data, and ensuring that the free movement of personal data within the Union is neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with data protection.

    "question": "How does the GDPR define an 'identifiable natural person' in relation to personal data?",
    "answer": "An 'identifiable natural person' is defined as someone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This includes personal data that has undergone pseudonymisation if it can be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information. To determine identifiability, all means reasonably likely to be used, considering costs, time, and available technology, should be taken into account. The GDPR principles do not apply to anonymous information (data that does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or is rendered anonymous) or to the personal data of deceased persons.

    "question": "What are the key conditions for obtaining valid consent from a data subject under the GDPR?",
    "answer": "For consent to be valid under the GDPR, it must be given by a clear affirmative act, establishing a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data. This can include written or oral statements, ticking a box on a website, or choosing technical settings, as long as it clearly indicates acceptance. Silence, pre-ticked boxes, or inactivity do not constitute consent. The data subject must be aware of the controller's identity and the purposes of processing. Consent is not freely given if the data subject lacks genuine choice, cannot refuse or withdraw consent without detriment, or if it is a prerequisite for a contract performance when not necessary.

Firstly, if their processing activities are related to offering goods or services to data subjects located within the Union, regardless of whether a payment is involved. This intent can be inferred from factors such as using a language or currency common in EU Member States, or explicitly mentioning EU customers. Secondly, it applies if the processing activities are related to monitoring the behavior of data subjects as far as their behavior takes place within the Union, which includes tracking individuals online for profiling purposes to analyze or predict personal preferences, behaviors, and attitudes.

Personal data should be collected for explicit, legitimate, and specified purposes, and should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for those purposes (data minimization). There should be limits on storage periods, ensuring data is not kept longer than necessary, and inaccurate data should be rectified or deleted. Finally, personal data must be processed securely, ensuring confidentiality and protection against unauthorized access or use. [cite: 386, 539, 540, 541, 542, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550]",
